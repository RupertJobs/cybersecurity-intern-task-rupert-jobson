 AI Usage Documentation

Where AI Was Used
I used AI assistance to help structure the markdown templates, improve clarity in written explanations, and refine the organisation of the final submission.  
All security reasoning, risk analysis, technical explanations, and incident response logic were developed independently.

Why AI Was Used
AI was used to streamline formatting, ensure professional presentation, and improve readability.  
This allowed me more time to focus on the technical depth and accuracy of the assessment.

Key Prompts Used
1. Requesting structured outlines for each part of the task.  
2. Refining markdown formatting for GitHub.  
3. Improving clarity and organisation of written sections.

What I Kept, Changed, or Rejected
I kept structural suggestions that improved readability.  
I modified or rewrote sections where AI output lacked technical depth or did not fully align with the scenario.  
I rejected any content that felt generic or did not reflect realistic SaaS security practices.

Original Analysis
All threat modelling, attack surface evaluation, risk prioritisation, technical attack paths, defence strategies, and incident response reasoning were created through my own analysis.  
AI did not generate any final security conclusions or recommendations; it was used only to support formatting and clarity.
